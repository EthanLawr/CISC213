![Repository Size](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/EthanLawr/cisc213)

This is a repository for my Computer Science III class and includes all of the projects and work done in class.
This repository does not include any tests or quizzes.

## Discussions

There are several discussions done with each class module. These discussions are designed to show participation in the class as well as to show that any given student can explain a given subject. Included in this folder are the given questions, my answers, and relevant files to each question. An example of the format can be seen at the [Discussion Guideline](./Examples/DISCUSSION_GUIDELINES.md). The discussion folder may be found [here](./Discussions/).

## Labs

Atleast 1 lab is assigned per class module. Each lab is required to have psuedo code, a uml diagram, and relevant code. Included in the relevent folder are my own lab submissions. Labs may be found [here](./Labs/).

## Definitions

Class Module - These are equivalent to chapters, or class sections. Each module contains a subject to focus on for each student.
